# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately by emailing the maintainers. Do not open a public issue.

## Security Model

ContainAI enforces sandbox-first execution with fail-closed defaults. See the [Technical README](agent-sandbox/README.md#security) for details on the security model.

Detailed security documentation is coming soon.
