## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it via [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/novotnyllc/containai/security/advisories/new). Do not open a public issue.

We aim to respond within 48 hours and will work with you to understand and address the issue.

## Security Model

ContainAI enforces sandbox-first execution with fail-closed defaults. See the [Technical README](agent-sandbox/README.md#security) for details on the security model.

Detailed security documentation is coming soon.
