## Flow-Next

This project uses Flow-Next for task tracking. Use `.flow/bin/flowctl` instead of markdown TODOs or TodoWrite.

**Quick commands:**
```bash
.flow/bin/flowctl list                # List all epics + tasks
.flow/bin/flowctl epics               # List all epics
.flow/bin/flowctl tasks --epic fn-N   # List tasks for epic
.flow/bin/flowctl ready --epic fn-N   # What's ready
.flow/bin/flowctl show fn-N.M         # View task
.flow/bin/flowctl start fn-N.M        # Claim task
.flow/bin/flowctl done fn-N.M --summary-file s.md --evidence-json e.json
```

**Rules:**
- Use `.flow/bin/flowctl` for ALL task tracking
- Do NOT create markdown TODOs or use TodoWrite
- Re-anchor (re-read spec + status) before every task

**More info:** `.flow/bin/flowctl --help` or read `.flow/usage.md`

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd sync
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
