# SSH
# NOTE: SSH is NOT imported by default for security reasons.
# Users who need SSH keys in containers should add ~/.ssh to
# [import].additional_paths in containai.toml.
# Agent forwarding (ssh -A) is the preferred approach.
#
# These entries document the link structure but are NOT in _IMPORT_SYNC_MAP.
# If users add ~/.ssh via additional_paths, these links will be created.
