Launch-agent and run-agent (bash + PowerShell) now enforce the hardened runtime: containers start with --read-only roots, named volumes for /workspace, /home/agentuser, and /toolcache, tmpfs mounts covering /tmp plus apt/dpkg paths, and memory-swap equals memory limits. EntryPoint seeds tmpfs overlays each boot, package caches point into /toolcache via ENV, and the bash run-agent tears down its per-session volumes after the container disappears.

Both launchers also force security profiles: every container runs under `docker/profiles/seccomp-coding-agents.json` (blocks ptrace/clone3/mount/etc.) and the AppArmor profile `coding-agents` when supported, with helper overrides (`CODING_AGENTS_SECCOMP_PROFILE`, `CODING_AGENTS_APPARMOR_PROFILE_*`, disable flags). Tests in `scripts/test/test-launchers.{sh,ps1}` cover the new helpers.
