Documented concrete host-to-container secret flows for Copilot (`~/.copilot/config.json`), Codex (`~/.codex/auth.json`), and Claude (`~/.claude/.credentials.json`) inside `docs/secret-broker-architecture.md`. Added Mermaid diagrams plus five-step implementation plans covering launcher capability issuance, tmpfs mounts, new prepare-* helpers, Dockerfile entrypoint sequencing, and updated launcher tests.
