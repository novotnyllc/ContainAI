Launch-agent (scripts/launchers/launch-agent) still runs containers with only cap-drop, pids limit, CPU/memory. It omits --memory-swap, --read-only, tmpfs mounts, and safe writable overlays that exist in the hardening plan, and does not accept CODING_AGENTS_EXTRA_DOCKER_ARGS. Any package manager writes go to the root filesystem, so the container remains writable. Needs full parity with run-agent + new read-only root plumbing.
