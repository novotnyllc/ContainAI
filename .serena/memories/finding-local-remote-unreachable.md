# Finding: Auto-push remote points to host path not mounted in container
- Category: Logic Bug / Incorrect Behavior
- Files: scripts/launchers/run-agent (volume args and LOCAL_REPO_PATH env), scripts/launchers/launch-agent, scripts/utils/common-functions.sh (generate_repo_setup_script), scripts/runtime/entrypoint.sh (cleanup_on_shutdown)
- Problem: When launching from a local repo, the launchers mount the host repo read-only at `/tmp/source-repo` (`-v <host path>:/tmp/source-repo:ro`) but set `LOCAL_REPO_PATH` to the original host path (e.g., `/Users/alice/project`). Inside the container `generate_repo_setup_script` runs `git remote add local "$LOCAL_REPO_PATH"`, so the remote URL points to `/Users/alice/project`—a path that is **not mounted or reachable** in the container namespace. As a result `cleanup_on_shutdown`'s `git push local <branch>` always fails, meaning the documented "auto-push back to host" safety never works for local repos.
- Impact: Users rely on auto-push to sync agent work back to the host before containers stop. Instead, commits stay stranded inside the container; the host repo never sees the work, risking data loss if the container is removed.
- Expected: Mount the host repo somewhere writeable (e.g., `/mnt/local-repo`) and point `LOCAL_REPO_PATH` to that mount, or set the remote to `file:///tmp/source-repo` so pushes go to the mounted copy. Auto-push should succeed by default.
