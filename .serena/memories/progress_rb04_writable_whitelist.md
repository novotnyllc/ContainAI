RB-04 (writable whitelist) now has working plumbing: docker/base snapshots mutable root dirs and exposes a /toolcache volume, entrypoint seeds tmpfs overlays on every container restart, and both launch-agent + run-agent (bash + PowerShell) mount named volumes for /workspace, /home/agentuser, and /toolcache while running containers with --read-only plus tmpfs mounts for /tmp, apt caches, and dpkg metadata. Package managers point to /toolcache via ENV so apt/pip/npm installs stay inside the approved zones.
