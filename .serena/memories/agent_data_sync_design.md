Exec interception clarified: vendor agent binaries (GitHub Copilot CLI, OpenAI Codex, Anthropic Claude) stay untouched. During image build we drop wrappers for known subcommands and also attach a seccomp user-notification filter to the `agentcli` namespace that traps all execve/execveat/posix_spawn calls. The host-side agent-task-runner daemon receives the notifications, launches approved commands inside the `agentuser` namespace, streams back STDIO, and denies the original exec. This ensures every agent-initiated process is forced through the isolated runner even if the upstream binary invents new execution paths.
