- Description: Containers build from `coding-agents-base` (Ubuntu 22.04/24.04) layering tooling plus entrypoint logic. Entrypoint copies repo from /tmp mount into /home/agentuser/workspace, configures git remotes, sources MCP secrets, and executes the selected agent under non-root user `agentuser` (UID 1000).
- Impact: Non-root default reduces privilege, but entrypoint performs host-sourced git config and executes arbitrary agent command, so any tampering in mounts/entrypoint affects runtime trust.
- Likelihood: n/a (informational)
- Severity: Informational
- Recommended Action: Preserve non-root execution and review entrypoint for least-privilege when modifying container startup.
