- ID: SECRETS-003
- Category: Secret Exposure
- Source: scripts/launchers/launch-agent (credential fallbacks around lines 330-360)
- Description: Even when the Git credential proxy socket is available, the launcher unconditionally mounts `~/.git-credentials` (if it exists) into the container. The entrypoint’s helper treats it as a fallback, but the file still contains plaintext PATs or OAuth tokens that any container process can cat and reuse.
- Impact: If the host ever uses the credential store helper, every stored token becomes exposed to the agent container regardless of proxy usage, enabling immediate repo or service compromise.
- Likelihood: Medium (many developers have ~/.git-credentials from earlier workflows; mount happens automatically).
- Severity: High
- Recommended Fix: Do not mount `~/.git-credentials` at all unless the proxy socket is unavailable and the user explicitly opts in; ideally migrate to socket-only access or ephemeral gh CLI tokens.
