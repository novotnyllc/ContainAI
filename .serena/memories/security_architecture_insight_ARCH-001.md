- Description: The platform launches per-agent containers via `launch-agent` scripts that copy the host repo into an isolated `/workspace`, mount host OAuth credentials and optional MCP secret env files read-only, and configure dual git remotes (origin and host-local). Each container runs a managed agent process plus MCP servers. Trust boundary sits at the Docker container boundary: host provides credentials + source via read-only mounts, while agent activities remain inside `/workspace` with git push over mounted helpers.
- Impact: Establishes baseline trust assumptions—host secrets remain on host except for read-only mounts; containers hold working copy plus agent operations.
- Likelihood: n/a (informational)
- Severity: Informational
- Recommended Action: Use this model when assessing escape vectors or mounts; ensure any new features respect the read-only credential mounts and workspace isolation.
