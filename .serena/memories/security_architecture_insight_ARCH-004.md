- Description: Git credential access relies on a host-side Unix socket service (`git-credential-proxy-server.sh`) exposed read-only to containers via helper scripts. Protocol enforces GET-only semantics with strict validation, rate limiting, and audit logging; containers never store credentials locally and fall back to gh CLI or file-based helpers if the proxy is unavailable.
- Impact: Introduces a critical trust boundary at the Unix socket mount—compromised containers can request credentials but cannot mutate host state. Security depends on socket permissions, validation, and helper correctness.
- Likelihood: n/a
- Severity: Informational
- Recommended Action: Maintain strict socket permissions and validation; ensure helper scripts are kept minimal and audited when changing credential flow.
