  "review": "- Severity: Major; File:Line: `agent-sandbox/containai.sh:1030`; Problem: `docker volume inspect` failures are treated as \u201cno credential volume found\u201d and return success, which masks real errors (daemon down, permission issues, transient failures) and misleads troubleshooting; Suggestion: capture stderr only on failure, treat only \u201cno such volume/not found\u201d as benign, and surface other errors with a non\u2011zero exit.\n\n<verdict>NEEDS_WORK</verdict>\n"
