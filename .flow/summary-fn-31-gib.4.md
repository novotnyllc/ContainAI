Added sync-manifest consistency checking with CI enforcement. Created `scripts/check-manifest-consistency.sh` that verifies `_IMPORT_SYNC_MAP` in import.sh matches manifest entries. Added lint job to CI workflow that runs on PRs. Updated parse-manifest.sh to handle `disabled` field with `--include-disabled` flag. Generators now include disabled entries for symlinks while consistency check excludes them from import map validation.
