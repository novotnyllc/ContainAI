# fn-15-281.4 Wire update check into containai.sh command dispatch

## Description
Wire the update check into the main CLI entry point before command dispatch.

**Size:** S
**Files:** `src/containai.sh`

## Approach

Add call to `_cai_update_check` early in the main function, before command dispatch.

Should run:
- Before every `cai` command
- After library sourcing is complete
- Before any actual work begins

Skip conditions (handled by `_cai_update_check` internally):
- Running on macOS (platform guard in update check)
- Bundle not installed (guard in update check)
- Running in CI environment (`CI=true`, `GITHUB_ACTIONS`, `JENKINS_URL`)
- `CAI_UPDATE_CHECK_INTERVAL=never`

The CI environment check should be handled at the call site in containai.sh to avoid even calling the function.

## Acceptance
- [ ] `_cai_update_check` called before command dispatch
- [ ] Skipped in CI environments (check before calling)
- [ ] Skipped when interval=never (handled by update check)
- [ ] Does not affect command execution timing significantly
- [ ] Works correctly on macOS (update check returns early)
- [ ] Works correctly when bundle not installed (update check returns early)
- [ ] shellcheck passes

## Done summary
Wired the `_cai_update_check` function into the main `containai()` CLI entry point. The update check runs before command dispatch, but is skipped in CI environments (CI, GITHUB_ACTIONS, JENKINS_URL) and for informational commands (help, version).
