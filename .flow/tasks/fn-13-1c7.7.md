# fn-13-1c7.7 Write final recommendations document

## Description
Synthesize all research into a final recommendations document with clear decision guidance, implementation roadmap, and security assessment.

**Size:** M
**Files:** Output to `.flow/research/fn-13-1c7/RECOMMENDATIONS.md`

## Approach

1. Summarize findings from tasks 1-6
2. Rank integration options by:
   - Security (highest weight for ContainAI)
   - Implementation effort
   - Spec compliance / compatibility
   - Maintenance burden
3. Make a clear recommendation with rationale
4. **Complete the Conflict Matrix** from epic spec:
   - `workspaceFolder`/`workspaceMount` vs `/home/agent/workspace`
   - `remoteUser`/`containerUser`/`updateRemoteUserUID` vs `agent` user
   - `overrideCommand` vs systemd entrypoint
   - `forwardPorts`/`portsAttributes` vs SSH port model
   - Env merging precedence
   - Lifecycle hook timing relative to SSH
5. Outline implementation phases:
   - Phase 1: Minimal safe subset
   - Phase 2: Feature support
   - Phase 3: Full spec (if feasible)
6. Document known limitations and future work
7. List follow-up implementation epic tasks

## Key context

The recommendation should consider ContainAI's principles:
- Security first - sandbox integrity is non-negotiable
- Bash-based tooling - prefer shell over Node.js dependencies
- Sysbox foundation - solutions must work with Sysbox runtime
- User transparency - make clear what's blocked and why
- Primary path: devcontainer inside Sysbox system container (DinD)

## Acceptance
- [ ] All research findings synthesized
- [ ] Options ranked with clear criteria
- [ ] Single recommended approach with rationale
- [ ] **Conflict matrix completed** with resolution recommendations
- [ ] Phased implementation roadmap
- [ ] Known limitations documented
- [ ] Follow-up implementation tasks listed (sized S/M)
