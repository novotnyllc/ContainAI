# fn-16-4c9.4 install.sh re-run calls cai update

## Description

When install.sh is run on an existing installation, call `cai update` instead of `cai setup`. This ensures existing installations stay current. Safe because fn-16-4c9.7 implements template hash checking.

**What to implement:**
1. In `install.sh`, detect existing installation:
   - Check if `$INSTALL_DIR/.git` exists AND `$BIN_DIR/cai` exists
   - If both exist: this is a re-run
2. For re-runs:
   - After git pull, run `CAI_YES=1 "$BASH4_PATH" "$BIN_DIR/cai" update` instead of setup
   - Same interactive/non-interactive rules as fn-16-4c9.3
3. Add messaging to clarify what's happening:
   - First run: "Running initial setup..."
   - Re-run: "Updating existing installation..."

**Consent propagation:**
The `CAI_YES=1` environment variable is passed so that `cai update` auto-confirms prompts. This is set in BOTH cases:
- Interactive: After user confirms prompt, CAI_YES=1 is set for cai update
- Non-interactive with --yes: CAI_YES=1 is set for cai update

This is safe because:
- Template hash check (fn-16-4c9.7) makes update non-destructive by default
- User explicitly consented (interactively or via --yes flag)

**Dependency note:**
This task depends on fn-16-4c9.7 (template hash) being implemented. The update command is safe because:
- Same template hash → apt update only (non-destructive)
- Different hash → prompts for confirmation (unless CAI_YES=1)

**Files to modify:**
- `install.sh`: Add re-run detection, call update instead of setup

## Acceptance
- [ ] Re-running install.sh calls `cai update` instead of `cai setup`
- [ ] First-time install still calls `cai setup`
- [ ] `CAI_YES=1` is passed to cai update when --yes used
- [ ] `CAI_YES=1` is passed to cai update after interactive confirmation
- [ ] Clear messaging distinguishes first run vs re-run
- [ ] Same --yes / --no-setup flags work for both cases
- [ ] Re-run detection is reliable (checks both .git and cai binary)

## Done summary
Re-running install.sh now calls `cai update` instead of `cai setup` when both `.git` and the wrapper exist. CAI_YES=1 is passed for consent propagation in both --yes and interactive confirmation modes, with clear messaging distinguishing first run ("Running initial setup...") from re-run ("Updating existing installation...").
