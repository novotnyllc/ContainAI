# fn-44-build-system-net-project-restructuring.6 Update documentation for build and project changes

## Description
**DEFERRED TO SEPARATE EPIC** - Documentation updates will be handled in a follow-up documentation epic after this build system epic is complete.

**Size:** S (deferred)
**Files:** None in this epic

## Approach

This task is a placeholder noting that documentation will be addressed separately.
## Approach

1. **AGENTS.md**: Update Quick Commands section with new build flags and .NET build commands.

2. **src/README.md**:
   - Update project structure to show new ContainAI.Acp library
   - Update build instructions for slnx
   - Document ArtifactsOutput paths

3. **docs/testing.md**: Add E2E test section explaining sysbox requirements and CI coverage.

4. **CHANGELOG.md**: Add entries under Unreleased for all changes.

## Key context

- AGENTS.md is built-in reference, must stay current
- Documentation uses Keep-a-Changelog format
- Per docs-gap-scout: AGENTS.md, src/README.md, docs/testing.md are highest priority
## Acceptance
- [ ] Documented in follow-up epic
## Done summary
TBD
