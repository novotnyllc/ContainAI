# fn-44-build-system-net-project-restructuring.6 [DEFERRED] Documentation updates - separate epic

## Description
**DEFERRED TO SEPARATE EPIC** - Documentation updates will be handled in a follow-up documentation epic after this build system epic is complete.

**Size:** S (deferred)
**Files:** None in this epic

## Approach

This task is a placeholder noting that documentation will be addressed in a separate follow-up epic. No implementation work is required in this epic.

Documentation that will need updating (tracked in follow-up epic):
- AGENTS.md: Quick Commands section with new build flags and .NET commands
- src/README.md: Project structure with ContainAI.Acp library
- docs/testing.md: E2E test section with sysbox requirements

## Key context

- This is intentionally deferred to keep the build system epic focused
- Documentation epic will follow after this epic completes

## Acceptance
- [ ] Documented in follow-up epic specification

## Done summary
TBD
