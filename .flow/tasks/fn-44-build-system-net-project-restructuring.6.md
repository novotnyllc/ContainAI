# fn-44-build-system-net-project-restructuring.6 [DEFERRED] Documentation updates - separate epic

## Description
**DEFERRED TO SEPARATE EPIC** - Documentation updates will be handled in a follow-up documentation epic after this build system epic is complete.

**Size:** S (deferred)
**Files:** None in this epic

## Approach

This task is a placeholder noting that documentation will be addressed in a separate follow-up epic. No implementation work is required in this epic.

Documentation that will need updating (tracked in follow-up epic):
- AGENTS.md: Quick Commands section with new build flags and .NET commands
- src/README.md: Project structure with ContainAI.Acp library
- docs/testing.md: E2E test section with sysbox requirements

## Key context

- This is intentionally deferred to keep the build system epic focused
- Documentation epic will follow after this epic completes
- Follow-up epic: **fn-45-comprehensive-documentation-overhaul** (Comprehensive Documentation Overhaul)
- fn-45 spec line 36 explicitly notes: "fn-44 changes (defer until that epic completes)"

## Acceptance
- [x] Documented in follow-up epic specification

## Done summary
# fn-44-build-system-net-project-restructuring.6 Done Summary

## What was done

Verified that this deferred documentation task is properly tracked in the follow-up documentation epic fn-45-comprehensive-documentation-overhaul.

## Key findings

1. **Follow-up epic exists**: fn-45-comprehensive-documentation-overhaul (Comprehensive Documentation Overhaul) is already created
2. **Explicit tracking**: fn-45 spec line 36 states "fn-44 changes (defer until that epic completes)" in Out of Scope section
3. **Comprehensive coverage**: fn-45 covers broader documentation needs including CLI reference, persona pages, config examples

## Documentation items deferred to fn-45

From this task's description:
- AGENTS.md: Quick Commands section with new build flags and .NET commands
- src/README.md: Project structure with ContainAI.Acp library
- docs/testing.md: E2E test section with sysbox requirements

These will be addressed as part of fn-45's comprehensive documentation overhaul once the dependencies (fn-46, fn-47) complete.

## Acceptance criteria met

- [x] Documented in follow-up epic specification (fn-45 explicitly references fn-44 deferral)
