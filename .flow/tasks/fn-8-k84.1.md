# fn-8-k84.1 Update README to indicate Mac support for cai import

## Description
Update the README.md to indicate that `cai import` is now supported on macOS, not just Linux/WSL.

**Size:** S
**Files:** agent-sandbox/README.md

## Approach

- Change line 54 from "**Linux/WSL only** - macOS is not yet supported" to indicate Mac is now supported
- Keep the note about what `cai import` does (syncs plugins, settings, and credentials)
- Follow existing documentation style in README.md
## Acceptance
- [ ] README.md line 54 updated to indicate Mac support
- [ ] Wording is clear and consistent with rest of README
- [ ] No other documentation needs updating (verify sync scripts section still accurate)
## Done summary
TBD
