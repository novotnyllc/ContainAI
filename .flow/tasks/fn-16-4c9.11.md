# fn-16-4c9.11 [MOVED] VS Code Docker context status bar

## Status: MOVED TO SEPARATE EPIC

This task has been moved out of the Platform Setup & Bootstrap epic as it's not related to core setup/bootstrap functionality.

**Reason:** The VS Code status bar setting is a nice-to-have IDE integration, not a platform setup requirement. It should be tracked in a separate "IDE Integration" or "Developer Experience" epic.

## Original Description

During `cai setup`, optionally configure VS Code's Docker extension to show the containai-docker context in the status bar.

## Action Required

- Create new epic for IDE integrations if needed
- Move this task to that epic
- Or delete this task if not prioritized

## Acceptance
- [x] Task moved out of fn-16-4c9 scope

## Done summary
N/A - moved to separate epic
