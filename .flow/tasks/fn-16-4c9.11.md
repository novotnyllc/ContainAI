# fn-16-4c9.11 Add VS Code Docker context status bar setting to setup

## Description

During `cai setup`, optionally configure VS Code's Docker extension to show the containai-docker context in the status bar. This makes it easy for users to see which Docker context they're using.

**What to do:**
1. After creating the containai-docker context in setup, prompt the user:
   - "Configure VS Code to show Docker context in status bar? [y/N]"
2. If yes, update VS Code Machine settings files:
   - `~/.vscode-server/data/Machine/settings.json`
   - `~/.vscode-server-insiders/data/Machine/settings.json`
3. Setting to add: `"containers.contexts.showInStatusBar": true`
4. Merge with existing settings (don't overwrite the file)
5. Create parent directories if they don't exist
6. Skip quietly if VS Code server directories don't exist

**Implementation notes:**
- Use `jq` for JSON manipulation (already available)
- Handle symlinks (current files are symlinked to /mnt/agent-data)
- Be careful with file permissions (600 or 644)

## Acceptance
- [ ] Prompt during cai setup asks about VS Code Docker context status bar
- [ ] If user says yes, settings.json files are created/updated
- [ ] Existing settings are preserved (merged, not overwritten)
- [ ] Works for both .vscode-server and .vscode-server-insiders
- [ ] No error if VS Code server directories don't exist (skip quietly)
- [ ] Handles symlinked settings.json correctly
