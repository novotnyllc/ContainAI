# fn-13-1c7.3 Evaluate CLI wrapping approach

## Description
Evaluate using @devcontainers/cli as the parsing layer, filtering its output before container creation. Analyze feasibility, security implications, and implementation complexity.

**Size:** M
**Files:** Output to `.flow/research/fn-13-1c7/option-cli-wrapping.md`

## Approach

1. **Evaluate CLI inside Sysbox container first** (preferred - no host Node dependency)
   - Can CLI run inside the system container?
   - Does it work with DinD?
2. Analyze `devcontainer read-configuration` output format
3. Determine which security-sensitive fields appear in output
4. Prototype filtering the output (conceptual, not implementation)
5. **Document build handling explicitly**:
   - Where does image build execute? (host daemon vs DinD inside Sysbox)
   - How to enforce feature allowlist/digest pinning?
   - What's exposed during build (network, .git, tokens)?
6. Identify limitations:
   - Can we intercept before Docker commands run?
   - Does the CLI respect filtered config or re-read original?
   - Node.js dependency implications for shell-based ContainAI
7. Document pros/cons vs direct parsing

## Key context

Key CLI commands to investigate:
- `devcontainer read-configuration` - parses and merges config
- `devcontainer up` - creates container (may be hard to intercept)
- `devcontainer run-user-commands` - executes lifecycle hooks
- `devcontainer exec` - runs commands in container

**Prefer evaluating "CLI inside Sysbox container" first** to avoid host Node.js dependency. Host installation is optional/fallback.

## Acceptance
- [x] CLI-inside-Sysbox feasibility assessed first
- [x] CLI output format documented
- [x] Security-sensitive fields in output identified
- [x] Filtering feasibility assessed
- [x] **Build handling documented**: where builds run, feature control, supply-chain
- [x] Node.js dependency implications documented
- [x] Pros/cons table vs alternatives
- [x] Clear recommendation on viability

## Done summary
Evaluated @devcontainers/cli as parsing layer for devcontainer support. Key findings:
- CLI-inside-Sysbox is feasible and preferred (keeps Node.js isolated, builds sandboxed in DinD)
- CLI `read-configuration` provides full spec parsing with variable substitution
- Main limitation: cannot cleanly intercept between parse and launch (`up` re-reads original)
- Node.js dependency adds 150-200MB to system container image
- Verdict: MODERATE viability - hybrid approach (CLI for parse, manual docker for launch) may be cleaner
