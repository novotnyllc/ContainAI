# fn-13-1c7.5 Evaluate alternative approaches (DevPod, Envbuilder)

## Description
Evaluate alternative approaches to devcontainer support: DevPod-style provider abstraction, Envbuilder-style daemonless builds, and any other creative options discovered during research.

**Size:** M
**Files:** Output to `.flow/research/fn-13-1c7/option-alternatives.md`

## Approach

1. **DevPod analysis** (loft-sh/devpod):
   - How does their provider abstraction work?
   - Could ContainAI be a "provider" for DevPod?
   - Security properties they enforce
   - Integration complexity

2. **Envbuilder analysis** (coder/envbuilder):
   - How does daemonless building work (Kaniko)?
   - Could this eliminate Docker socket exposure?
   - Compatibility with Sysbox
   - Build time implications

3. **Other options**:
   - Running @devcontainers/cli inside the container (not on host)
   - Pre-built image registry (skip build, use curated images)
   - Minimal devcontainer subset (only image + workspaceFolder)

4. Document each with effort estimate and security tradeoffs

## Key context

Reference implementations found:
- coder/coder: Go interface wrapping devcontainer CLI
- loft-sh/devpod: Full parsing with security properties
- coder/envbuilder: Kaniko-based daemonless builds
- STRML/claude-cells: Security tier system for AI sandboxing
## Acceptance
- [ ] DevPod architecture analyzed
- [ ] Envbuilder architecture analyzed
- [ ] At least one creative alternative explored
- [ ] Each option has effort estimate (S/M/L)
- [ ] Security tradeoffs documented for each
- [ ] Clear ranking of options
## Done summary
TBD
