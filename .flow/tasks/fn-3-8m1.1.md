# fn-3-8m1.1 Add platform guard to sync-agent-plugins.sh

## Description
Add `check_platform()` function that blocks on macOS with clear error message.

**Implementation** (from spec lines 17-35):
```bash
check_platform() {
  case "$(uname -s)" in
    Linux) return 0 ;;  # Includes WSL
    Darwin) echo "ERROR: macOS is not supported by sync-agent-plugins.sh yet" >&2; return 1 ;;
    *) echo "ERROR: Unsupported platform: $(uname -s)" >&2; return 1 ;;
  esac
}
```

Call at script start before any operations.
## Acceptance
- [ ] `check_platform()` function exists
- [ ] Returns 0 on Linux/WSL
- [ ] Returns 1 with error on Darwin
- [ ] Returns 1 with error on unknown platforms
- [ ] Called early in main() before sync operations
## Done summary
Added check_platform() function to sync-agent-plugins.sh that blocks execution on macOS with clear error message, allows Linux/WSL to proceed. Platform guard is called at start of main() before argument parsing, preventing any bypass via --help.
