# fn-16-4c9.5 Fix cai setup description and help text

## Description

Update help text and messaging to accurately describe the setup behavior on each platform, especially documenting Lima VM usage on macOS.

**What to implement:**
1. In `src/lib/setup.sh`, update `_cai_setup_help()`:
   - Add macOS section mentioning Lima VM
   - Example: "On macOS, creates a Lima VM running Ubuntu with Docker and Sysbox"
2. In `install.sh`, update post-install messaging:
   - Current text says "Install Sysbox (Linux/WSL2)" - needs to mention macOS Lima
   - Add: "On macOS, this creates a lightweight Linux VM using Lima"
3. In `src/containai.sh`, update `containai_help()` if it mentions setup:
   - Ensure description matches actual behavior

**Current issue:**
The install.sh post-install message focuses on Linux/WSL2 and doesn't mention that macOS uses Lima VM, which could confuse users.

**Files to modify:**
- `src/lib/setup.sh`: Update `_cai_setup_help()`
- `install.sh`: Update post-install instructions
- `src/containai.sh`: Update help if needed

## Acceptance
- [ ] `cai setup --help` mentions Lima VM for macOS
- [ ] install.sh post-install text mentions macOS Lima setup
- [ ] Help text accurately describes what setup does on each platform
- [ ] No misleading references to "Sysbox on macOS" (it's in the Lima VM)

## Done summary
Updated help text and post-install messaging to accurately describe setup behavior per platform: macOS uses Lima VM with Docker + Sysbox inside, Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)/WSL2 auto-installs Sysbox, other distros require manual setup.
