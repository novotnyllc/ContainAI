# fn-18-g96.9 Skip Sysbox isolation checks when already in Sysbox container

## Description
When `cai` runs inside a Sysbox system container, nested Sysbox is unsupported
and the usual Sysbox runtime checks should not block execution. Detect this
environment and skip Sysbox/isolation verification silently while falling back
to the default Docker context and a non-Sysbox runtime for nested containers.

## Acceptance
- [ ] `_cai_select_context` succeeds inside a Sysbox container even if
      `sysbox-runc` is not available on the inner daemon.
- [ ] `cai doctor` (text + JSON) does not report Sysbox runtime errors when
      running inside a Sysbox container.
- [ ] Isolation preflight checks are skipped without warnings in this mode.
- [ ] Container creation uses `--runtime=runc` when nested inside Sysbox.

## Done summary
Implemented nested-Sysbox detection and bypass behavior:
- Added `_cai_is_sysbox_container` detection using userns remap + sysboxfs mount.
- Skipped Sysbox runtime verification when already inside Sysbox.
- Made isolation preflight checks silent in nested Sysbox mode.
- Switched container runtime to `runc` when nested.
- Updated doctor output to report "Outer Sysbox container" and avoid sysbox-default warnings.
