# fn-18-g96.9 Skip Sysbox isolation checks when already in Sysbox container

## Description

When `cai` runs inside a Sysbox system container, nested Sysbox is unsupported
and the usual Sysbox runtime checks should not block execution. Detect this
environment and skip Sysbox/isolation verification silently while falling back
to the default Docker context and a non-Sysbox runtime for nested containers.

**Note: This functionality already exists in the codebase.** The implementation is complete:
- `_cai_is_sysbox_container()` in `src/lib/container.sh` detects nested Sysbox
- Uses userns remap + sysboxfs mount detection
- Skips Sysbox runtime verification when inside Sysbox
- Uses `--runtime=runc` for nested containers
- Doctor output updated appropriately

This task should be marked done after verification that existing code meets all acceptance criteria.

## Acceptance

- [ ] `_cai_select_context` succeeds inside a Sysbox container even if
      `sysbox-runc` is not available on the inner daemon.
- [ ] `cai doctor` (text + JSON) does not report Sysbox runtime errors when
      running inside a Sysbox container.
- [ ] Isolation preflight checks are skipped without warnings in this mode.
- [ ] Container creation uses `--runtime=runc` when nested inside Sysbox.
