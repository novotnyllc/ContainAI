# fn-16-4c9.6 Setup consolidation: cleanup legacy references

## Description

The original task was to merge `scripts/install-containai-docker.sh` into `lib/setup.sh`. However, that file doesn't exist - the setup logic is already consolidated in `src/lib/setup.sh`. This task is now about cleaning up any stale references and ensuring documentation is accurate.

**What to verify/clean:**
1. Search for references to `install-containai-docker.sh` in:
   - Documentation (docs/*.md, README.md)
   - Code comments
   - CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md
2. Remove or update any stale references
3. Verify `src/lib/setup.sh` is the canonical setup location
4. Update epic spec references if needed

**Files to check:**
- `docs/*.md`
- `README.md`
- `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`
- Code comments in `src/lib/*.sh`

## Acceptance
- [x] No references to `install-containai-docker.sh` exist in codebase
- [x] No references to `scripts/install-containai-docker.sh` in docs
- [x] Documentation correctly points to `src/lib/setup.sh` as setup location
- [x] AGENTS.md references are accurate

## Done summary
Verified that setup consolidation is complete. The legacy `scripts/install-containai-docker.sh` script was deleted in previous work (fn-14-nm0.3). All references in documentation, source code, and AGENTS.md are clean. The only remaining references are in `.flow/` task history files, which is expected as they document the consolidation history. Confirmed `src/lib/setup.sh` is the canonical setup location with platform-specific functions (`_cai_setup_linux()`, `_cai_setup_macos()`, `_cai_setup_wsl2()`).

## Evidence
- Commits: Verification only - no changes needed (prior cleanup in fn-14-nm0.3)
- Tests: grep searches confirmed no stale references in docs/, src/, README.md, AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md
