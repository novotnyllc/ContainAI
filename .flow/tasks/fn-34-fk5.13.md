# fn-34-fk5.13: Implement helpful error for missing agent

**STATUS: OUT OF SCOPE**

This task was part of the original plan to redesign `cai run` syntax.
After review, the existing behavior is preserved (no breaking changes).
The default agent configuration already exists via `_containai_resolve_agent`.
