# fn-18-g96.7 Remove cai sandbox command

## Description

Remove the `cai sandbox` command and implement proper unknown command handling so it errors instead of falling through to `_containai_run_cmd`.

**Current behavior:** Unknown commands fall through to `_containai_run_cmd` which treats them as workspace paths.

**Desired behavior:** Unknown command-like tokens (alphanumeric, starts with letter) should error clearly.

**Changes needed in `src/containai.sh`:**

1. Remove the `sandbox)` case from the dispatcher (~line 2483)
2. Remove `_containai_sandbox_cmd()` function (~line 1010)
3. Modify the catch-all case to distinguish between:
   - Paths (start with `/` or `.` or contain `/`) → pass to run
   - Flag-like tokens (start with `-`) → pass to run
   - Command-like tokens (alphanumeric) that aren't existing directories → error

**Updated dispatcher:**
```bash
case "$subcommand" in
    run|shell|doctor|...) # Known commands
        shift
        _containai_${subcommand}_cmd "$@"
        ;;
    -*)
        # Flags go to default run
        _containai_run_cmd "$@"
        ;;
    /*)
        # Absolute path - run command
        _containai_run_cmd "$@"
        ;;
    ./*|*/*)
        # Relative path with directory component - run command
        _containai_run_cmd "$@"
        ;;
    *)
        # Unknown token
        if [[ -d "$subcommand" ]]; then
            # Bare directory name that exists - run command
            _containai_run_cmd "$@"
        else
            # Looks like unknown command - single line error matching epic spec
            _cai_error "Unknown command: $subcommand. Run 'cai help' for available commands."
            return 1
        fi
        ;;
esac
```

**Error message format (EXACT - single line):**
```
[ERROR] Unknown command: sandbox. Run 'cai help' for available commands.
```

## Acceptance

- [ ] `cai sandbox` outputs exactly: `[ERROR] Unknown command: sandbox. Run 'cai help' for available commands.`
- [ ] `cai sandbox` exits with code 1
- [ ] `cai /path/to/workspace` still works (absolute path)
- [ ] `cai ./relative/path` still works (relative path)
- [ ] `cai existingdir` still works if directory exists
- [ ] `cai --detached` still works (flags to run)
- [ ] `cai unknowncommand` errors if not a directory
- [ ] `_containai_sandbox_cmd` function removed
- [ ] No backward compatibility shim
- [ ] Error message is exactly ONE line (not two)
