# Glossary

This document defines the core terminology and concepts used in the ContainAI architecture.

## Core Concepts

### Agent
The AI runtime environment running inside a container. Examples include `copilot`, `codex`, and `claude`. Each agent runs in its own isolated container with a specific configuration.

### Launcher
The host-side script (e.g., `run-agent`, `launch-agent`) responsible for:
1. Verifying host prerequisites.
2. Sealing secrets into a Capability Bundle.
3. Orchestrating the Docker container and its sidecars.
4. Managing the lifecycle of the session.

### Payload
An immutable, versioned artifact (OCI artifact) that contains the installer scripts, host tools, and default configurations. The payload is downloaded by the installer and extracted to the install root.

### Channel
A release stream that determines which version of the payload and images are used:
- **dev**: Bleeding edge, built from the latest commit on `main`.
- **nightly**: Daily builds that have passed integration tests.
- **prod**: Stable, tagged releases.

## Architecture Components

### Secret Broker
A helper process (or logic within the launcher) that manages the secure injection of secrets. It "seals" secrets from the host into a bundle that is mounted into the container, ensuring secrets are never exposed as environment variables.

### Capability Bundle
An encrypted or signed package containing the secrets and configuration for a specific session. This bundle is mounted into the container's `tmpfs` at `/run/containai`.

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)
An open standard that allows AI models to interact with external tools and data. ContainAI uses MCP to provide agents with access to git, GitHub, and other services.

### MCP Stub
A lightweight proxy process running inside the agent container. It intercepts MCP requests from the agent and forwards them to the appropriate handler (or validates them against the Capability Bundle) before executing them.

### Sidecar
A helper container that runs alongside the main agent container to provide auxiliary services.
- **Proxy Sidecar**: A Squid proxy for network filtering and audit logging.
- **Log Forwarder**: A service that captures logs and ships them to a central collector.

### Shim (WSL Shim)
A lightweight PowerShell script (`.ps1`) on Windows that acts as a bridge to the Linux environment. It translates paths and arguments, then invokes the corresponding Bash script inside WSL 2.

## Data Management

### Local Remote
A bare Git repository stored on the host (default: `~/.containai/local-remotes`). The agent container pushes changes to this remote rather than the user's working tree to prevent file locking issues and ensure atomic updates.

### Session Manifest
A JSON document generated by the launcher for each session. It describes the configuration, mounts, environment variables, and security policies for that specific container instance. It is hashed and logged for audit purposes.
